# NumberClash : Real-time communication card game that involes combination of numbers. 

NumberClash is real-time communication game where players compete by comparing their hands of two random numbers. Players have the option to request new numbers up to three times to aim for a higher combination, although there's no guarantee of improvement over previous combinations. The numbers range from 1 to 10, and the sum of two numbers determines their hands against opponents. However, if the sum exceeds 10, the player's hand is the sum of their two numbers divided by 10, akin to using the modulo operation. (e.g., 4 and 9 is 3, not 13)

> Independently created a multiplayer card game with real-time capabilities using SignalR for communication, ASP.NET for backend operations, and React for the frontend.
